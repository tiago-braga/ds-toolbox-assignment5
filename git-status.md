The git status command in git can be used to provide the current status of your repository, including files that got modified, file staged for commit and also untracked ones.
In case you're using the jupyter lab IDE insteaf of a terminal, you can just navigate to the Git tab and the interface will provide you with visual info on the repository status, with basically the same info as the git status command in a terminal.
